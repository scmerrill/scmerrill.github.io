I am a CS major attending New Mexico Tech. This is my personal website for writeups and random other blogging.

What else do you need?

### my history

As of now I don't have much work to showcase as most of it is schoolwork that may violate academic honesty rules

If you need to contact me, I can be reached at spencer@spencermerrill.com or smerrill@cs.nmt.edu

Stay tuned for updates to this site to see what random (and more than likely useless) projects I am ready to present and showcase
